        As a UX/UI designer with a passion for physical product design, 3D design, music production, and
          embedded electronics, I’ve explored various creative disciplines over the years. Through multiple design
          projects, I’ve discovered that my true passion lies in the latter stage of the design process - when concepts
          transition into tangible designs, and the physical form starts to emerge. I enjoy experimenting with
          materials, shapes, sizes, tactile qualities, and aesthetics, and I feel most fulfilled when an idea becomes
          something that can be seen, touched, and experienced.

            <span class='description'>
                This project successfully developed a functional audio sampler, similar to commercial models, while
                providing insights into their design and functionality. Although the prototype closely resembles
                existing products, it helped uncover the rationale behind common design choices, which are often
                undisclosed by manufacturers. Through testing multiple interfaces, I identified the most effective
                interactions for sample recording, manipulation, and playback. Additionally, the project deepened my
                understanding of real-time audio processing, embedded electronics, and interaction design, revealing the technical complexities involved.

            <span class='description'>
                This project explored the development of an interactive, collaborative music-making ecosystem
                designed for novices, using four primitive-shaped objects that influence the soundscape in unique
                ways. Findings indicate that the system's interdependent design fosters an intuitive learning
                experience, enabling non-musicians to engage enjoyably and grasp its mechanics within minutes, even
                without instructions. Participants demonstrated the ability to map specific configurations to
                outputs, with rounded shapes being easier to interpret. My responsibilities were to develop the
                technical infrastructure, including hardware wiring, coding, and all necessary software setup. I took
                the lead in designing the interactive objects, with some contributions from my groupmates, and handled
                the laser cutting. Since the assembly process was particularly challenging, the entire group
                participated in putting the objects together.

            <span class='description'>
                This research aimed to design a non-visual interface in order to simplify music library navigation in
                cars using haptic rotary dials. The prototype incorporated artificial haptic detents and
                sounds, allowing users to navigate through the library. Three different interaction approaches were
                tested, from which only one was shown to be usable. The prototype's design and assembly involved
                experimenting with dial sizes and haptic patterns. The final prototype avoided visual affordances
                to prevent unnecessary behavior expectations. Overall, this research offers a potential solution to
                reduce driver’s distraction and improve music library interaction in personal vehicles.
