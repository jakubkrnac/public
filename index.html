        As a UX/UI designer with a passion for physical product design, 3D design, music production, and
          embedded electronics, I’ve explored various creative disciplines over the years. Through multiple design
          projects, I’ve discovered that my true passion lies in the latter stage of the design process - when concepts
          transition into tangible designs, and the physical form starts to emerge. I enjoy experimenting with
          materials, shapes, sizes, tactile qualities, and aesthetics, and I feel most fulfilled when an idea becomes
          something that can be seen, touched, and experienced.

                As a product designer at Panomio, I am responsible for the full user experience and visual identity of the product. I work across the entire app, including both the dashboard and the course authoring builder. As the only product designer, I lead the design work in close collaboration with the product owner, aligning decisions to ensure the product meets both user and business needs. I conduct user research, design user flows and components, and work closely with developers throughout the process, receiving continuous feedback on technical implementation. Alongside this, I manage and develop the design system and design the website and promotional materials to ensure a consistent and cohesive product experience. I find it deeply rewarding to improve the product every day, make it easier to use, and continuously strengthen my design skills.

            <span class='title'>Hybrid prototyping exploration</span>
            <span class='description'>
                This thesis explores a hybrid prototyping approach for functional prototyping, aimed at lowering technical barriers for interaction design students and recent graduates. The platform separates physical input from software logic, allowing microcontrollers to handle sensing while a browser based application manages interaction and media. Developed through material exploration and iterative prototyping, the platform was evaluated by replicating and extending a previously developed audio sampler. User testing compared the hybrid platform to a traditional embedded workflow, revealing that the hybrid platform supported faster iteration, clearer debugging, and greater accessibility for non-experts. The findings suggest that such a setup is well suited for early-stage design work, where flexibility and speed are essential. While the platform may not replace embedded systems in all contexts, it offers a compelling alternative for creative prototyping in education and exploratory design.

            <span class='description'>
                This project successfully developed a functional audio sampler, similar to commercial models, while
                providing insights into their design and functionality. Although the prototype closely resembles
                existing products, it helped uncover the rationale behind common design choices, which are often
                undisclosed by manufacturers. Through testing multiple interfaces, I identified the most effective
                interactions for sample recording, manipulation, and playback. Additionally, the project deepened my
                understanding of real-time audio processing, embedded electronics, and interaction design, revealing the technical complexities involved.

            <span class='description'>
                This project explored the development of an interactive, collaborative music-making ecosystem
                designed for novices, using four primitive-shaped objects that influence the soundscape in unique
                ways. Findings indicate that the system's interdependent design fosters an intuitive learning
                experience, enabling non-musicians to engage enjoyably and grasp its mechanics within minutes, even
                without instructions. Participants demonstrated the ability to map specific configurations to
                outputs, with rounded shapes being easier to interpret. My responsibilities were to develop the
                technical infrastructure, including hardware wiring, coding, and all necessary software setup. I took
                the lead in designing the interactive objects, with some contributions from my groupmates, and handled
                the laser cutting. Since the assembly process was particularly challenging, the entire group
                participated in putting the objects together.

            <span class='description'>
                This research aimed to design a non-visual interface in order to simplify music library navigation in
                cars using haptic rotary dials. The prototype incorporated artificial haptic detents and
                sounds, allowing users to navigate through the library. Three different interaction approaches were
                tested, from which only one was shown to be usable. The prototype's design and assembly involved
                experimenting with dial sizes and haptic patterns. The final prototype avoided visual affordances
                to prevent unnecessary behavior expectations. Overall, this research offers a potential solution to
                reduce driver’s distraction and improve music library interaction in personal vehicles.
